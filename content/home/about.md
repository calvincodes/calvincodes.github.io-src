# Biography

I am a Senior Software Engineer at Sumo Logic in the Redwood City. I am a part of the Core Platform team which is responsible for orchestrating all the incoming requests to Sumo Logic from both API and UI layer.

I did my B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati in 2015. After this, I joined Myntra Designs Pvt. Ltd. (e-commerce platform in India) and worked as a Senior Software Engineer for 3 years. I then pursued my MS in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and graduated in December 2019. 

I am passionate about Software Security, Big Data Systems, Highly Available & Scalable Services, REST, and Microservices Architecture. I also maintain a [tech-blog](https://medium.com/calvin-codes), where I write about bugs and vulnerabilities in various libraries and frameworks.
