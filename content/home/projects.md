1. **Sign Language to Text Converter from live video** [(Project Website)](https://sites.google.com/view/asl-to-text-converter/)
   * Detects hand gestures in a live video, identifies if it represents an ASL symbol, and prints it on screen.
   * Primarily uses convolutional neural network and frameworks like TensorFlow, Theano, and Keras.
    
    
2. **Present Sir - Android App** (Independent Project) [(Concept Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9rnnGhQz9k)
    * 1000+ downloads. Allows students to create customized class schedule & enable attendance tracking.
    * Used SharedPreferences APIs to create a local database and LinearLayout view group for the user interface.
    
    
3. **Make - Build Tool** [(GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/calvincodes/make-build-tool)
    * Reads, validates and executes make files, using fork and execvp for command execution.    

    
4. **Speech based Information Retrieval IVR System** (Bachelor Thesis Project)
    * Responds to inquiries related to the market price of various vegetables in the regional Assamese language.
    * Used morphological image processing techniques in the spoken term detection from continuous speech.
    * Includes automatic tagging and retrieval of spoken documents in an unsupervised framework.
    * Worked with techniques like Dynamic Time Warping and Hidden Markov Model for Artificial Neural Network.
    
    
5. **MedAssist: An automated medication kit** (Texas Instruments Innovation Challenge) [(Concept Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovw96Q_Qpd8)
    * Smart First-Aid box to store medicines & remotely notify patients of their medication schedule.
    * Built the algorithm for notification module in C++ and Arduino, which used Bluetooth channel.
